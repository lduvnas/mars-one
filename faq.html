                        <h3>Why on earth would anyone move to Mars? </h3>
                        <p>The short answer is. Because we can. Why did Columbus travel west? Why did Marco Polo head
                            east?
                            Because it is that pull, that unknown, that prospect of adventure that compels humans to
                            seek
                            new
                            frontiers to explore.</p>

                        <p> Sending a manned mission to Mars is a fantastic adventure. Imagine living on another planet,
                            millions of miles from the Earth; looking up into the sky with the knowledge that one of the
                            'stars'
                            is actually the planet you were born on. Who can even envision the incredible feeling of
                            being
                            the
                            first human in history to step out of the capsule and leave your footprint on the surface of
                            Mars?
                            By this we implore you to not just think of that feeling for the astronaut, but the
                            experience
                            for
                            all those watching back home. Those who observed Neil Armstrong land on the Moon all those
                            years
                            ago
                            still remember every detail â€“ where they were, who they were with and how they felt. The
                            moment
                            the
                            first astronauts land on Mars will be our moment to remember.</p>

                        <p>A second reason is good, old-fashioned curiosity. Where did Mars come from? Can it teach us
                            about
                            Earth's history? Is there life on Mars? These are just three of the hundreds of burning
                            questions
                            for scientists all over the world.</p>

                        <h3>Is this trip risky?</h3>
                        <p>The trip to Mars cannot be called risk free. Like any venture in any means of travel, there
                            are
                            always things that could go wrong. In the case of Mars One, the following risks are
                            conceivable:</p>

                        <ul class="article-list">
                            <li><span class="list-content">Accident(s) during launch</span></li>
                            <li><span class="list-content"> components could malfunction</span></li>
                            <li><span class="list-content"> could be problems when landing</span></li>
                        </ul>


                        <p> Although traveling to Mars will evidently bring risks, if you were to compare our mission to
                            the
                            first Moon mission in 1969, it quickly becomes apparent that this mission is much safer.

                            construction,
                            maintenance and research. Besides work, they will also have time to relax.</p>

                        <h3>How long does it take to travel to Mars?</h3>
                        <p>The trip takes around seven months; a bit longer than astronauts currently stay on the
                            International
                            Space Station.</p>

                        <p> The precise duration of each journey depends on when it is taken. Because both Mars and
                            Earth's
                            orbits are not perfectly circular, the time it takes to travel between them varies from six
                            to
                            eight
                            months.</p>

                        <p>When determining the course to Mars, the maximum travel time for the astronauts is very
                            important.
